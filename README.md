This is my go at the Advent of Code challenge for 2020.  
https://adventofcode.com/2020

I'm taking a stab at using good old JS nothing fancy as I need to get better at it.  
Hopefully as the month goes on my solutions will be a bit more elegant.  
We shall see.

Each day will be split up with an html/js file so it can be ran in the browser to see.  
I might spiff it up a bit but for now it's fine.
